calculation1: dielectric region II has an electric permitivity of 1
calculation2: dielectric region II has an electric permitivity of 10‚Å∂
calculation3: like calculation1 but with salt
calculation4: like calculation2 but with salt
calculation5: dielectric region II has an electric permitivity of 1. Surface charge density (positive). The charged surface is composed by a grid of 10000 point charged separeted by 1 angstrom. Charges located at y=-1.
calculation6: like calculation5 but charges shifted at y=-0.05.
calculation7: like calculation5 but negatively charged surface.
calculation8: like calculation7 but charges shifted at y=-0.05.
calculation9: von Neumann boundary condition on the flat region (positive charge).
calculation10: von Neumann boundary condition on the flat region (negative charge).
